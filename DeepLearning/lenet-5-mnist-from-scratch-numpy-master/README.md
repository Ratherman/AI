Note: In this hw, I use the open src code from https://github.com/toxtli/lenet-5-mnist-from-scratch-numpy

# Goal
* Compare the LeNet5 and Improved LeNet5

# LeNet5

* Activation Function: Sigmoid
* Kernel size: 5x5
* The curves of the training accuracy and validation accuracy
* The predicted result on the validation set (evaluated in top-1 accuracy)
* The predicted result on the testing set

# Improved LeNet5

* Activation Function: ReLU
* Kernel size: 3x3
* Increase one convolution layer to LeNet5 (any position)
* The curves of the training accuracy and validation accuracy
* The predicted result on the validation set (evaluated in top-1 accuracy)
* The predicted result on the testing set
