## Dataset:
1. Kaggle Digit Recognizer Dataset [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data)

## Progress
1. Build LeNet From Scratch, and use it to classify MNIST Dataset
    1. Draw the blueprint.
    2. Build LeNet from scratch.
    3. Prove the backward propagation is actually working!
        * By using single example, and saw the loss curve going down.
        * By using 50 examples, and still saw the loss curve going down.
        * By using 2000 examples, and still wating for the result ...
    4. Get the sense of how to choose non-hyper and hyper parameters.

    * To-Do
        1. Test Relu.
        2. Build Keras-Version LeNet5, and compare the performance.
        3. Write "Prediction" function.
        4. Draw the blueprint for mini-ImageNet

2. Generalize the model to the mini-ImageNet dataset.
