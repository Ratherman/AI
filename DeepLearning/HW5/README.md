# Introduction
In HW5, we are going to cope with AOI - task. It's basically a classification problem where the input would be a PNG file and the output would be the desired label.

# Grades
1. LeNet-like Model v1: Train Acc 84%, Test Acc. 80%
    * best train acc: 91%
    * Learning Rate: 1e-3
    * epoch: 15

2. LeNet-like Model v2: Train Acc xx%, Test Acc. xx%
    * best train acc: 91%
    * Learning Rate: 1e-4
    * epoch: 30

# Labels
There are 6 different labels listed below:
* 0 - Normal
* 1 - Void
* 2 - Horizontal Defect
* 3 - Vertical Defect
* 4 - Edge Defect
* 5 - Particle

2.  (DONE 2021/05/08) Get a feel of data, draw it.
3.  (DONE 2021/05/16) "PyTorch" DataLoader
5.  (DONE 2021/05/16) "PyTorch" Version of Model (MVP --> Just a simple backbone ^_^)
8.  "PyTorch" DataAugmentation
10. Recap Teacher's Approach to build a good model.
11. "Pytorch" Build a model as best as possible.
4.  "Tensorflow" DataLoader
