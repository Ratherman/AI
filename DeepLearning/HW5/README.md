# Introduction
In HW5, we are going to cope with AOI - task. It's basically a classification problem where the input would be a PNG file and the output would be the desired label.

# Labels
There are 6 different labels listed below:
* 0 - Normal
* 1 - Void
* 2 - Horizontal Defect
* 3 - Vertical Defect
* 4 - Edge Defect
* 5 - Particle

# Strategies
1.  (DONE 2021/05/08) Understand the background knowledge.
2.  (DONE 2021/05/08) Get a feel of data, draw it.
3.  "PyTorch" DataLoader
4.  "Tensorflow" DataLoader
5.  "PyTorch" Version of Model (MVP --> Just a simple backbone ^_^)
6.  "Tensorflow" Version of Model (MVP --> Just a simple backbone ^_^)
7.  Start to use TensorBoard.
8.  "PyTorch" DataAugmentation
9.  "Tensorflow" DataAugmentation
10. Recap Teacher's Approach to build a good model.
11. "Pytorch" Build a model as best as possible.
12. "Tensorflow" Build a model as best as possible.
