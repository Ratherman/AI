# Assignment-Image Classification

## Used Methods/ Algorithms
* OpenCV: Extract Features from original data.
    * Recommended Image Feature Extraction Methods
        1. Global color histogram
        2. HoG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
        3. BoVW (Bag of Visual Words)
* Perceptron: It's a linear classifier for predicting the label.
* XGboost: Use it for comparison purpose.
* Random Forest: Use it for comparision purpose.

## Features for this repo
* Hand-crafted Perceptron Algorithm
* Image Feature Extraction
* Explain How to train a model and evaluate performance.

### (2021/03/12 08:30 - 09:50)
1. Study the dataset
2. Write a program to make sure each folder contains 1,300 pics. (train.txt exist?)
3. Upload pics to Google Drive. Temporarily do this hw on Google Colab.
4. Can see the image in RGB format.

### (2021/03/13 10hr)
1. Write a binary classifier (Single Layer Perceptron with binary cross entropy) from scratch on my own dataset.
2. Search for Derivatives of Softmax (dE/dZ, where Z is the input of softmax)

### (2021/03/14 10hr)
1. Writa a multi-class classifier (Single Layer Perceptron with cross entropy) from scratch on my own dataset.
2. Get familiar with XGBoost.
3. Understand Random Forest.
4. Get familiar with Random Forest.
