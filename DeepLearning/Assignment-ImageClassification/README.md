# Assignment-Image Classification

## Used Methods/ Algorithms
* OpenCV: Extract Features from original data.
    * Recommended Image Feature Extraction Methods
        1. Global color histogram
        2. HoG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
        3. BoVW (Bag of Visual Words)
* Perceptron: It's a linear classifier for predicting the label.
* XGboost: Use it for comparison purpose.
* Random Forest: Use it for comparision purpose.

## Features for this repo
* Hand-crafted Perceptron Algorithm
* Image Feature Extraction
* Explain How to train a model and evaluate performance.

    * [Perceptron Link](https://github.com/Vercaca/Perceptron/blob/master/perceptron.py )
2. Download the datasets.
3. Try to run simple pla.

### (2021/03/12 08:30 - 09:50)
1. Study the dataset
2. Write a program to make sure each folder contains 1,300 pics. (train.txt exist?)
3. Upload pics to Google Drive. Temporarily do this hw on Google Colab.
4. Working on read the image dataset now.
